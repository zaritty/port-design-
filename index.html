  <h3>Quiz Project</h3>
  <img src ="port image 1.png">
  <p>This is project was made in the beginning of the year.I made it as an assignment for a do now, we worked on this for a little bit of time but in the end it came out ok. </p>

  <p>Mr Revera (my teacher) gave us a project/assighnment to do. It was to make a sort of a click game, very basic but fun. I based my story off of "Gorefield", since i thought it would go perfect together. </p>

  <p>The short story of this is project is sorta boring. I didn't have a main thought to make it look nice or interesting. I followed what Mr Revera wanted and did it. </p>

  <img src ="port image 4.png">
  <p>This was my first attempt on making a website. We made it basic for it being our first try. Now adays I think it could use a make over if i have time for it. Other than some of it not ageing well I think its an ok attempt </p>

  <img src ="port image 5.png">
  <p>This was a small assignment Revera wanted to do. it doesn't look like much but thats the point. The highlighted text is supost to show a image of that character or in this case seriers. We never really expanded on this. Maybe ill make it more creepy.</p>
